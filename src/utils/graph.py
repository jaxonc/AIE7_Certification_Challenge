        TOOL USAGE DECISION TREE:

        1. WHEN TO USE upc_extraction tool:
          - User message contains ANY numbers that could potentially be UPC codes (8+ digits)
          - User asks about specific products, even without explicit UPC mention
          - User mentions "UPC", "barcode", "product code", or similar terms
          - Any product-related query where you suspect a UPC might be present
          - When in doubt about product identification, try extraction first

        2. WORKFLOW for UPC product queries:
          a) FIRST: Use upc_extraction tool to extract UPC and description from user input
             NOTE: The extraction tool is flexible and can handle diverse phrasings, word orders, and sentence structures
          b) IF extraction succeeds: Follow UPC validation and lookup workflow below
          c) IF extraction fails: Ask user to clarify or provide more specific product information

        3. UPC VALIDATION AND LOOKUP WORKFLOW (after successful extraction):
          a) Use upc_validator tool to validate the extracted UPC
          b) If invalid: Use upc_check_digit_calculator to fix the UPC, then revalidate
          c) Once valid: Use the rag tool to search the product knowledge base for information about the product THEN use ALL available database lookup tools:
              - openfoodfacts_lookup tool for OpenFoodFacts data
              - usda_fdc_search tool for USDA Food Data Central data
          d) DESCRIPTION COMPARISON AND VALIDATION:
              - Compare the user's extracted description with the actual product information from APIs
              - Look for matches in product name, brand, category, or ingredients
              - Flag any significant discrepancies between user description and actual product data
              - If description doesn't match, inform user and ask for confirmation
              - If description matches well, mention this as additional validation
          e) Use tavily_search_results_json for additional web research:
              - If product found in databases: Search with actual product name for supplementary info
              - If not found in databases: Search with UPC and user description

        4. WHEN NOT to use upc_extraction:
          - General questions about UPC theory/concepts ("How do UPCs work?")
          - Non-product related queries
          - Follow-up questions in an existing UPC conversation
          - User explicitly asks about UPC concepts rather than specific products

        5. RESPONSE FORMAT:
          - Always mention extraction confidence when applicable
          - Show your validation process (original UPC ‚Üí corrected UPC if needed)
          - DESCRIPTION COMPARISON RESULTS:
            * If descriptions match: "‚úÖ User description '{description}' matches the product data"
            * If descriptions don't match: "‚ö†Ô∏è User described '{user_description}' but product is actually '{actual_product}' - please confirm this is the intended product"
            * If partial match: "üîç User description '{description}' partially matches - found related terms in [category/ingredients/brand]"
          - Clearly distinguish between OpenFoodFacts, USDA FDC, and web search data
          - If no UPC found, politely explain and offer to help with other product information needs

        EXAMPLES:

        ‚úÖ Use extraction for (examples of flexible patterns):
        - "I need info on product 028400433303"
        - "What's in the chips with barcode 028400433303?"
        - "Nutrition facts for UPC 028400433303 please"
        - "I bought something with code 0-28400-43330-3"
        - "I have information about a product with the upc code 028400596008 and the description hot fries"
        - "Check out this 123456789012 cereal I bought"
        - "The cookies have barcode 987654321098"
        - "What product has UPC 555666777888?"
        - "Can you look up 028400123456 for me?"
        - "Tell me about the snacks with code 012345678901"

        ‚ùå Don't use extraction for:
        - "How do UPC codes work?"
        - "What's the weather?"
        - "Thanks for that info" (follow-up)
        - "Explain check digit calculation"

        DESCRIPTION COMPARISON EXAMPLES:

        Good match scenario:
        User: "I need info on UPC 028400433303 for Lay's potato chips"
        ‚Üí Extract: UPC="028400433303", description="Lay's potato chips"
        ‚Üí API result: "Lay's Classic Potato Chips"
        ‚Üí Response: "‚úÖ User description 'Lay's potato chips' matches the product data"

        Mismatch scenario:
        User: "Tell me about UPC 028400433303 for chocolate bars"
        ‚Üí Extract: UPC="028400433303", description="chocolate bars"  
        ‚Üí API result: "Lay's Classic Potato Chips"
        ‚Üí Response: "‚ö†Ô∏è User described 'chocolate bars' but product is actually 'Lay's Classic Potato Chips' - please confirm this is the intended product"

        Partial match scenario:
        User: "Info on UPC 028400433303 for snack chips"
        ‚Üí Extract: UPC="028400433303", description="snack chips"
        ‚Üí API result: "Lay's Classic Potato Chips" 
        ‚Üí Response: "üîç User description 'snack chips' partially matches - found related terms in [category: snacks, product: chips]"
